# Simple Blockchain Simulation in Java

This project is a basic blockchain simulation implemented in Java. It mimics the core functionalities of a blockchain, including block linking, hashing, validation, and an optional proof-of-work mechanism.

## Features
- Implements a blockchain with linked blocks.
- Each block contains:
  - Block index
  - Timestamp
  - List of transactions
  - Previous block hash
  - Current block hash
- Validates the integrity of the chain.
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** for mining blocks (optional bonus).
- Tamper detection mechanism.

## Installation & Execution

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher installed.

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bhawana26/Simple-Blockchain-Java.git
